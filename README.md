# Predicting-and-Analyzing-Fuel-Efficiency

In this project I will be utilizing analytical dashboards for analyzing the data rich CSV files for various car models from the years 2013-2023. The analysis includes different features which affect the level of fuel consumption for various car categories, carbon and overall greenhouse emissions from burning fuel, and the relative monthly expenses for different cars. Those features include cylinders, car diplacement, city and highway miles per gallon, vehicle class, annual cost, and more. In addition, I will develop a model for predicting the estimated fuel/electricity consumption in miles per gallon and "possibly" the amounts of CO2 released according to the attributes in the dataset which were used to train the model. Finally, I might develop a recommendation system in parallel with the prediction model, which will display the recommended car brands based on the desired features the consumer chose from the different fields.
