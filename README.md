# Predicting-and-Analyzing-Fuel-Efficiency

In this project I will be utilizing analytical dashboards for analyzing the data rich CSV files for various car models from the years 2013-2023. Moreover, I will develop a model where the end user will enter the desired features for the custom car that they want, and an output for the estimated fuel/electricity consumption, monthly expenses based on current gas price, and the amounts of CO2 released according to the attributes in the dataset which were used to train the model. I will also use unsupervised learning techniques to group cars into different segments according to their fuel consumption and their overall structure. Finally, I might develop a recommendation system in parallel with the prediction model, which will display the recommended car brands based on the desired features the consumer chose from the different fields.
